*Mongo db is used to design document easily and seamlessly

*easy to use NoSQL database

------diff b/w mongo and mongod------------
Mongo is a command line where we give commands to insert data and other instructions where as mongoD is roughly can be called a compiler which just ecxecutes the commands given in mongo

*both the mongo and mongoD runs one after other 
-------------------------------------------
*we have added bin directory of mongo from c to the environment variables path so that if anytime we want to use mongo we have to simply write mongo and all the path will automatically be updated

----------------commands related Database---------

*TO VIEW ALL THE CONNTENTS OF DATABASE
	show dbs

*TO MAKE A NEW DATABASE or switch databases
	use dbName


*If we want to know which db we are working in
	db

*DELETE DATABASE
	db.dropDatabase()		//databse is a function here

---------commands related collection--------

*"db.dbName.insertOne({all the collection you need to fill})"

*db.dbname.insertMany([{},{},{}])	    	//to insert many documents in a single run


-if we do not provide any id to our collection mongo db automatically adds the id

*to check the collection of our database
	-db.dbName.find()
		or
	-db.dbName.find().pretty()
